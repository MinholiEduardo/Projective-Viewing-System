# Projective-Viewing-System

# Overview

This project consists of implementing a projective visualization system based on conic (perspective) projection.
The program must be developed in any programming language of your choice and submitted according to the course guidelines.

The system computes the 3D-to-2D projection of an object using a defined viewpoint, a projection plane, and the geometric data of the object. All calculations follow the mathematical model provided by the instructor.
